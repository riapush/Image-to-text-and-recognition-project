"""Terrible, terrible joy.
benjaminskylerhill 10 December 2022

With less than 1/4 of the budget of the soulless Disney live action remake earlier this
year, Del Toro & Co. Have managed to craft a version of Pinocchio with more personality,
heart, and soul than Disney could have dreamed of crafting

It injects new life into the character by telling a story that is vastly different both
narratively and thematically than any version we've seen on screen before.

This tale deals with the malleability of identity, unconditional love, the impressionable
nature of children, and the close link between joy and sorrow. And it does so with dark
wit, refreshingly complex three-dimensional characters, and stunningly haunting stop-
motion animation.

However, I do think this could have benefited a bit from cutting down on the plethora of
plot points and having Pinocchio and Geppetto spend more time together. This version
lacks the tight focus and brisk pacing of the 1940 version

But aside from this, I was thoroughly entranced by this dark fairy tale. It has a spine and
a soul, and unlike it's titular protagonist, it's far from wooden

"A good film that might not be for everyone
Jeremy Urquhart 28 November 2022

A new Guillermo Del Toro movie is always something worth getting excited about, and I
think his take on Pinocchio is another winner. While it might not live up to his very best
films, it's another strong addition to his filmography... though it's also worth mentioning
that he co-directed this one. Mark Gustafson is the other director, and he's not going to
get as much credit as Del Toro, being the lesser-known name. But I imagine you don't
get credited as a co-director unless you do a good deal of the work, so he shouldn't go
ignored.

It's easy to see why this take on the Pinocchio story was appealing to Del Toro. It's a
fairly dark fairytale, it deals with child characters in a cruel world, it blends fantasy and
real-world conflict (here, it's set in Italy I think either before or at the start of WW2), and
it's also a story with big emotions, being heartfelt and also surprisingly sad in places. All
these themes/directorial trademarks can be found in Del Toro's other films, which makes
this one feel right at home among them (even if it's the first to be animated).

The animation looks unique and is great to look at throughout. Unlike other animated
movies with unique looks, I didn't feel like this one took a while to get used to. It pulls
you in right away, and I think the music helps a great deal, too. It's overall a nice-looking
and nice-sounding movie, with pretty good voice-acting, too.

The fact that it deals with mature themes (surprising amounts of death and Fascism in
this movie) and might look unsettling to some, while also having child-friendly comic
relief and music numbers do make it feel a bit odd tonally. 1 appreciate the effort that
went into making this a movie with elements that'll appeal to younger viewers, and
elements that'll appeal to older viewers, but I'm not sure the variety of tones is always
balanced expertly. If I had any criticism, it's that, but otherwise, this is a very good
animated movie, and another triumph for Del Toro (and his co-director!).

macormaria 22 September 2022

Contrary to all the reviews i am seeing, 1 really liked the moviel! I am not an expert, just
a regular watcher but i can say | loved the plot, the acting, the twist/ reveal really
shocked me and overall as a simple watcher and not a movie expert with an impressive
watchlist i enjoyed it thoroughly! I also dont believe it is Olivia Wilde's fault there is so
much drama surrounding this movie, but the irrational fans' that invest themselves too
much in someone else's life. But after all, every single movie i watch has predominantly
bad reviews and disappointed people tied to it.

My favourite part was the reveal of the concept behind victory, and tho i genuinely dont

Plot twist lovers please buy your tickets.
Olivia Wilde is absolutely a genius.
You can hate her for her personality but this movie was fantastic.

I know there was a drama between her and Flo (and Harry and Chris), but in my opinion
that was just clever marketing.

Alll the actors/actresses did an amazing job. I have to highlight Florence's performance,
because she is so talented and was the perfect cast for the main character.

And Harry. Oh Harry. This boy suprised me with his acting skills. I didn't think that he will
be that good.

The whole story went pretty well from the beginning.
Those little details/flashes just made it even more psychic.

Only the ending was a little bit questionable for me but its alright.

TheLastOracle 23 September 2022

What I like about this movie is that it makes you use you mind rather than hold your
hand and spoon-feed you every little bit of info, the answers are already there, all you
have to do is look.

The plot was good and well thought out, but it did deter quite a bit from the script and
left out bits that would have added to the movie, but I suppose they had to soften is for
the more delicate viewers.

The twist and turns in this are quite clever and this does have an old vibe to it which is
good and certainly different from the constant action-packed movies or the over the top
romantic ones we have these days.

Florence Pughs acting was absolutely amazing, and had the movie stuck more to the
original script rather than focus on sex and being oh so glamorous, it would have been

more so.

Overall it is a pretty good movie, even if half of it was missing.

"""T'll tell you, but you can't use my name'
Red-125 3 February 2023

She Said (2022) was directed by Maria Schrader. It's a semi-documentary, based on the
New York Times investigation of Harvey Weinstein by reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan
Twohey.

(Zoe Kazan plays Kantor, and Carey Mulligan portrays Twohey.}

Ina sense, this movie is like many others-intrepid reporters using their professional skills
to bring down a truly terrible person. In this case, that person was Harvey Weinstein.

What we don't know-and what the movie shows us-was how difficult it was for Kantor
and Twohey to get women to talk on the record

""Everyone knew"" that Weinstein was a sexual predator. However, his position in the film
industry was such that he could crush anyone who refused his demands. (He also
survived by offering settlements to his victims. These settlements included a non-
disclosure clause.)

Even though we know the outcome, this film is still powerful

Kazan and Mulligan are extraordinary actors, and they bring to life the struggle of getting
women to talk on the record. It's worth watching the film to see if they can accomplish
this seemingly impossible task.

She Said has a pretty good IMDb rating of 7.2. (Of interest is that women rated it 7.5,
while men rated it 7.1.) I enjoyed this movie, and I thought that it was much better than
that. I rated it &

"This film packs a punch.
Sleepin_Dragon 27 August 2023

Two brave journalists, Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey work to unearth The Harvey
Weinstein scandal, one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, who preyed on many
women.

It's a very powerful, thought provoking film, just over two hours long, but well paced and
chillingly realistic, it's almost shocking to believe these events did actually happen. Very
well made, very well acted, the story of how a dangerous predator was finally taken to
task

There is something so sickening about NDA's they served to simply allow perpetrators to
get away with their crimes scott free.

It's a movement that seems to have changed the whole industry, exposing not just a
single predatory individual, who misused his immense sense of power and control, but a

whole network, a society that for two long remained protected.

Zoe Kazan and Carey Mulligan deliver terrific performances, the pair truly deliver very
powerful, very sincere performances, the pair combined particularly well

It's frightening to think how much has been brushed under the carpet over the years.

This is a very powerful story.

"SHE SAID is a quiet thriller that speaks many voices and volumes that
need to be heard, It will be hard to watch SHE SAID, but It needs to be
watched by every generation

GusherPop 11 January 2023

SHE SAID is a quiet thriller that speaks many voices and volumes that need to be heard,
It will be hard to watch SHE SAID, but It needs to be watched by every generation and
has to be addressed. In February 2020, a New York jury found Harvey Weinstein, the
producer whose films had won dozens of Oscars, guilty of criminal sexual assault and
rape. Now, two and a half years later, he is again on trial, in California, facing 11 further
charges. Jurors in this trial received a particular instruction: The judge barred them from
watching the trailer for ""She Said."" Others have largely eluded consequences. Debate
continues about whether the movement has gone too far or not far enough. Already,
some Hollywood industry leaders have observed a regression, if not an outright backlash
This is the contentious climate in which the film arrives. ""She Said,' directed by Maria
Schrader from a script by Rebecca Lenkiewicz, is built solid and low to the ground, as if
designed to withstand these shifts in cultural winds. ""She Said"" opens not in the
newsroom or in one of the hotel suites that Weinstein preferred, but in rural Ireland in
1992 when a young woman encounters a film crew, which swiftly adopts her. But only
seconds later she is shown running down a city street, panicked - a victim, it would
seem, of assault. In the film, as in life, the reporters benefit from a lucky break or two -
a source within the Weinstein Company (Zach Grenier), an admission by a Weinstein
lawyer (Peter Friedman). But ""She Said"" largely stresses the unglamorous grind of an
investigation: the phone calls, the doorstepping, the delicate moral suasion that reporters
use to convince sources to trust them. Here is the argument Twohey uses with the
women she speaks with: ""I can't change what happened to you in the past, but together
we may be able to use your experience to help protect other people."" ""She Said' details a
triumph of journalistic sympathy and precision. What will become of the real-world
movement this reporting kindled? The jury's still out.

okpilak 16 January 2023

This movie is about how journalism works. The work of journalists, not just a talking
head on television, but the effort involved in uncovering a story and getting the
collaboration of what they are reporting on. This isn't the story of the 5 o'clock evening
news that is heard and quickly forgotten. The strength of the movie is how they showed
the difficulty in getting the women to come forward, and the substantial power those in
control hold over others. I suspect from when this movie came out, that the postscripts
at the end were to be sort of a recap. Instead, I found them much too rosy assumptions
of what will be accomplished from getting the story out. In reality, this is only the
beginning of a long and difficult task ahead to benefit all in society. A good pairing for this
film would be Bombshell (2019).

A young man, like many others. Only he can travel in time. This main element of the
plot, is something that was difficult to digest throughout the film, since it was not a
predominantly sci-fi movie. This struggle was compensated by the successful interjection
that even with such ability, life can have difficulties.

The main character, did use this to his advantage to win the love of the girl he was so
fond of but still he often faced difficult choices as to let things happen or turn the time

back to prevent them.

Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187 2 December 2022

This film is NOT meant to have the light-hearted happy-go-lucky vibes of Disney's 1940
Pinocchio movie, but rather a modernised take praising the wonders of childhood, faith
and friendship; up against the all-consuming tyranny of fascism (its take on Mussolini is
hilarious), deceptive show-business tactics; and the double-edged sword of Time (and
Life) itself,

Pinocchio is a conceptually HEAVY film that doesn't condescend on its younger audiences
nor it's older ones: it respects all the age groups equally and without compromising the
story and fairytale-qualities of the Pinocchio story at its core. It's like a hard-boiled
folktale that knows when to be optimistic and when to be cautionary in equal measures;
and that's the magic Guillermo Del Toro does so goddamn well in SPADES.

This is 2022's best animated feature film, and one of Netflix's best film offerings in years.
And it was worth the wait on Del Toro's part too.

Guillermo Del Toro's Pinocchio is exactly that, a beautiful and unique interpretation of a
classic that explores death and grief in ways that are often emotional and heartbreaking
whilst still delivering a fun adventure with gorgeous animation against a classically
disturbing Del Toro backdrop.

Gregory Mann gives an incredible lead performance, imbuing Pinocchio with a boundless
warmth and naivety that thankfully never becomes annoying. Ewan McGregor makes for
a terrific comic relief and is an absolute joy to hear whenever he's on screen.

David Bradley is so good as Geppetto, subtly bringing so much pain to his character that
breaks your heart and makes his moments of happiness all the better to experience.
Rounding out the cast is Christoph Waltz, on point as usual with another truly evil
character.

Guillermo Del Toro's and Mark Gustafson's direction is absolutely phenomenal, everything
from the movement of the characters, to their designs and the vibrant colour palette is
gorgeous and endlessly watchable. The music by Alexandre Desplat is amazing, giving

"Absence Of A Single Likable Character (Or Over-Arching Message} May
Limit The Palette Here
zkonedog 26 November 2022

Mark Mylod's ""The Menu' is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness,
obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it
certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to
live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a
single character to really root for.

For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya
Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by
master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which
quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining' is
anything but.

To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu' was that it lacked any character I could
really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It
certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly
the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult
to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about
her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I
couldn't find a ""way in"".

T also believe that ""The Menu' is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to
see what sticks' sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the
picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to
the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.

Ican give ""The Menu' 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a
visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that
constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly
care one way or another.

kinda dumb, not the cute kinda dumb) behavior of the main character make this
unwatchable for me. I realize I'm not necessarily the target audience but I would
recommend staying away from this even if you are.

"Misandrist Gunk
fun_michael 11 March 2023

It's advertised in the trailer that not everything is what it seems in Don't Worry Darling"".
The resolution however is so misandrist that it is almost beyond belief, even accounting
for the fact that this is pile of gunk ( there is no other word to describe it sufficiently) is
directed by Olivia Wilde, a women using her position to engage inappropriately with main
actor Harry Styles. Stylistically the movie is not bad, however the scenes with cars
departing the homes in a choreographed fashion could have been done better, and the
way the movie was shot was not cinematic but the perspectives used made it feel like
one of those ""made for TV movies"". In terms of logic the movie is also extremely poor. In
summary a waste of valuable life time which I can never get back.

"Bad (clearly a man wrote the screenplay)
oliviakd 6 December 2020

Warning: Spoilers

The protagonist faces no consequences for manipulating women or any of his
actions in general. I'm not sure what the point of this movie is, it ends with the
protagonist learning he needs to reflect on the good parts of his life as if there
were any bad moments. The only thing that really stood out for me was how this
film managed to anger and bore me simultaneously.

"Incredibly boring
cdmarker2001 7 November 2021

The whole movie was honestly lacking in all areas... it wasn't exciting, dramatic,
suspenseful, funny... nothing, The plot was dull, slow paced, the acting was bland. The
time traveling aspect is the only intriguing part and even that wasn't enough to keep
things interesting. 2 hours I would like to get back.

I don't understand how this has as high of a rating as it does.

"Heteronormative claptrap
helensmith-99298 9 January 2023

Warning: Spoilers

I wasn't sure what to expect because of course this is from the same director as
Love Actually, but I had heard this was much better. I was very disappointed - this
film is suffocatingly heteronormative and narcissistic. The main character spends
most of the film going back in time so he can manipulate a woman into loving him.
The female characters are unsubstantial and it is very much a male vehicle. Also it
is full of stereotypes e.g why his wife has to spend ages in front of mirror trying
dresses on. That's not what all women do! The only character I liked was the dad.
Absolute claptrap that thinks it's much cleverer than it is. Wish I hadn't wasted 2
hours of my time watching this rubbish!

"The Trailer was better than the Movie ..
Avid_Movie_Viewer 30 January 2014

Warning: Spoilers

Thad expectations from the trailer that this would be a tale of a protagonist that
had some social shortcomings and how time travel would help him overcome them
to fall in love.

Instead the movie appeared to be a quest by our protagonist to appear smooth and
suave with wornen in manufactured relationship. Our protagonist Tim pursues two
young women\girls in the film. One was puppy love that never comes to fruition
and the other was completely manufactured by the time travel. I never saw a
connection between Tim and Mary. We're supposed to believe that they fall in love
with each other the very first day they meet. That was a bit much to believe. Worse
is that he uses the time travel to manufacture the relationship. That's not love It's a
guy manipulating someone

Tim appeared like a needy guy who didn't want to do anything to screw up and end
a relationship. He did screw up and end the relationships on multiple occasions but
with the time travel he went back and fixed it. Funny but the relationship came off
as not genuine.

The relationship between Tim and his dad appeared very genuine from beginning to
end. That was the strength of this movie.

T actually thought our hero Tim would be forced to sacrifice his manufactured
relationship with Mary with something important that would require him to time
travel back before meeting Mary or having his children. There was a chance for this
with his sister's accident or his father's death but Tim chooses to help himself
instead which left me disappointed that everything was so easy.

This movie had potential but it took the road most traveled

"An illogical plot device with no actual plot, that tr:
misery
Stay_away_from_the_Metropol 25 December 2020

off into aimless

The cast is great and they all do the best they could with this material. However, the
movie has no other strengths. In the beginning, it's like, ""Ok, it's a typical rom com but
with a family of men who can travel back in time. Seems goofy but maybe they chose
this absurd plot device for a reason'. Nope.

What seems like an intriguing and amusing stretch in the beginning goes absolutely
nowhere and by the time you make it to the last half hour of the movie you realize the
absurdist concept serves no actual purpose. There is no actual plot, and no conflict. The
protagonist uses time travel to cheat his way into getting a girl to fall in love with him,
and then....he faces zero consequences, almost zero obstacles, and there is literally
nothing that occurs in the second half of the film to keep the viewer intrigued. There's
not even a story outside of what would occur with any middle aged couple on the most
surface level. It just trails off into a miserable aimlessness. The last half hour is painful,
and by the time you get there you realize the movie is not only far too long, but it
shouldn't exist at all

It's been a while since I've seen a movie that is neither effective in a realistic sense, nor
in a surreal sense. It's caught somewhere in an illogical middle ground, which to me,
makes it worthless. It kind of reminds me of Stranger Than Fiction but with even less
charm (at least Maggie Gyllenhaal's character is super unique and memorable in that).
That Rachel McAdams smile isn't nearly enough to save this one.

"This is the end of Nolan.
mericdx 27 September 2023

Thad one more chance for Nolan after the garbage Tenet. And i have none now. This
movie shows you how money talks in Hollywood. There is nothing good about this movie,
there isn't any theme or clear conflict of the plot even. Everything is mixed together in
this bore- fest auto biographic film. Its scenes are ripped off from other films and this
film pretends it is bigger than it is with its over the top sound design. 1 don't recommend
anyone to waste their time and money to this.

No characther development, nothing you can relate, Soulless, passionless filmmaking. I
couldn't believe what i was seeing.

"Overhyped and boring, with giant holes in its scenario
tonym-13883 22 July 2023

This movie was overhyped to the death starting months before the screening. It was
hailed as the film who is going to save Hollywood, and humanity.

Ultimately, it was an extremely long and boring movie

It had a lame 10 minutes explosion scene which doesn't resemble any kind of nuclear
explosion, and to think that Christopher Nolan has claimed that there are no special
effects in this film and everybody was giggling to see a real nuclear explosion

Robert Downey Jr's character has taken the whole movie as a hostage and could have
been removed completely. As a matter of fact this movie could be an hour less without
having any effect on the story.

As for the story, there are so much subplots (including one with numerous full frontal
nudity!!) and the things are dragged so long, you will not remember anything substantial
when you leave the theatre.

The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it was great to see Gary Oldman
as US President.

But all in all, I feel so stupid for falling for this hype. Let this be a lessen for the next
time.
